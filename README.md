Want to test different ways to <u>share</u> parameters in (convolutional) neural nets.
The relation between parameter sharing schemes and tensor factorisations is especially
interesting.

### TODO.

Test with;

* atrous conv (sharing over scale)
* TT decompositions (sharing over ?!?)
* random recycling (sharing in depth or ??)
*
