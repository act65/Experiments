### Hypothesis.

Using dilated/atrous convolutions will allow the model to learn multi scale filters. Aka sharing parameters over scale.

### Experiment.

Artificially augment MNIST to make it have multi scale properties (randomly scale the digits).

Find minimal example where traditional conv fails and ... This will show that ...


To ensure fair tests we need to compare conv vs atrous conv with;
* no scaling
*

### Results.

... thus atrous conv should be used in XXX setting.
